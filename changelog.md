* Total main connector I/Os: 21
* Up to 4 PWM pairs
* Up to 12 analog input channels
* Up to 2 internal op-amps
* On-board isolated USB
* USB to UART (default)
* USB to I2C (configurable)
* Standard 5-pin programming port
* Also reconfigurable as UART
* External I2C connection
* Also reconfigurable as one PWM pair
